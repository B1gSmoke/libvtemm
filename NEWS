0.20.0:

* wrapped 0.20.0 version of vte.
  API/ABI compatible with 0.16.4, 0.17.1 and 0.19.0. (Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.1

* most changes backported from 0.19.1. (Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.2

* added new API (const getter methods) and fixed some memleaks.
  (Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.3

* API is incompatible with previous versions, so it is bumped to version 1.1.
Mostly recompilation is enough, but if you use commit signal, or cursor
position getter then a change in sources is needed.)
* SO version is also bumped.
* libvtemm-1.1 is parallel-installable with version 1.0.
* Dependencies: vte >= 0.20, gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.14, glibmm-2.4 >= 2.18.
(I'm not sure about the last, maybe lower would work, but that needs
change in configure.ac).
