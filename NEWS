0.21.0:

* Reenable the per-class hierarchy graphs in the reference documentation.
* Drop the custom HTML header and footer and use the shared doxygen.css
file from mm-common.
* Updated dependencies - previous were probably to low in some places.
(Krzesimir Nowak)

0.22.0:

* Use more sensible dependencies (cutting edge version are not necessary).
* Rebuild against new mm-common.
