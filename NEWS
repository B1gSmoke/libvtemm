0.20.0:

* wrapped 0.20.0 version of vte.
  API/ABI compatible with 0.16.4, 0.17.1 and 0.19.0. (Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.1:

* most changes backported from 0.19.1. (Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.2:

* added new API (const getter methods) and fixed some memleaks.
  (Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.3:

* This release is API/ABI _incompatible_ with previous releases.
(deprecated methods and reaper were removed, beep signal have a default
signal handler, 'commit' signal, 'set-scroll-adjustments' signal,
get_cursor_position and get_padding have changed prototypes, get_adjustment now
returns a reference instead of pointer and so on.) This probably doesn't matter
since almost nobody is using it.
* API is bumped to version 1.1.
* libvtemm-1.1 is can be installed in parallel with version 1.0.
(Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.4:

* This release has another API/ABI incompatibility, but only in Pty::Master,
so API bumped to version 1.2. libvtemm-1.2 can be installed in parallel with
versions 1.0 and 1.1, but usage of 1.1 is not recommended, because of stupid
design bug in Pty::Master.
* New build system using mm-common. Version 0.6 required. Dependencies are
written in README.
* TerminalAccessible now is not wrapped. I don't have a clue for what is it
and if it was wrapped properly. Probably it won't be missed.
(Krzesimir Nowak)

0.20.5:

* Reenable the per-class hierarchy graphs in the reference documentation.
* Drop the custom HTML header and footer and use the shared doxygen.css
file from mm-common.
* Updated dependencies - previous were probably too low in some places.
They will be updated in future, when stable version of libraries will be
released.
