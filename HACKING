If you happen to regenerate defs files please take a look at them, if something
have to be corrected manually (just have a look at defs files in earlier
versions):

in libvte_signals.defs:
	- check if commit p0 argument is gchar*, not const-gchar*.
in libvte_methods:
	- check if vte_terminal_accessible_new is defined as a constructor, not
	as a method of VteTerminal.
	- check if get_text* methods of VteTerminal are properly defined -
	h2def.py chokes on pointers to functions, so probably parameters after
	this pointer are not defined - correct it, and comment the pointer
	parameter. Definitions of these methods are needed for documentation
	purposes. If pointer to function will be typedefed, this step won't be
	needed.
in libvte_enums:
	- probably adding VteTerminalAntiAlias manually will be needed.
